![Virtual Pet]

Welcome to the Virtual Pet game! Take care of your virtual pet by feeding, playing, sleeping, bathing, and going on exciting adventures together.

## Features

- **Feeding**: Keep your pet well-fed and happy by giving them food. This action reduces hunger and increases happiness and health.

- **Playing**: Spend quality time with your pet, playing games together. Playing increases happiness but also raises hunger and reduces energy and cleanliness.

- **Sleeping**: Make sure your pet gets enough rest by letting them sleep. Sleeping replenishes energy and increases hunger.

- **Bathing**: Keep your pet clean and fresh by giving them a nice bath. Bathing increases cleanliness and happiness but slightly reduces health.

- **Adventures**: Embark on thrilling adventures with your pet! During an adventure, random events can happen, affecting your pet's attributes in different ways.

- **Status**: Check your pet's current status, including age, hunger, happiness, energy, cleanliness, and health.
